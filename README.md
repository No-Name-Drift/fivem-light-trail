### README
Just a reminder on the status of this script:
The script can work in always on mode or in braking mode.
The light trail is made using a networked ptfx.

In onesync networked ptfx aren't supported yet. So the script shouldn't sync at all among players.
In FXServer the script should sync correctly when used in always on mode, while shouldn't in braking mode as apparently the networked ptfx doesn't sync fast enough during the multiple variations it does locally.
